#Exploratory Data Analysis On Stack OverFlow Developers Survey 2022
In this Notebook I'll be looking at the dataset from stackoverflow, and perform data cleaning, analysis and mainly visualize the data imported to gain insights on it.

Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Numpy for high-level mathematical functions to operate on arrays, Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, and Seaborn for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics are used in this notebook to perform the necessary functions.

Data visualization is the representation of data through the use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.

This is the first visualization I've ever done and followed tutorial videos on youtube to create this notebook.
